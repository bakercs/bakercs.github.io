      <h1>The Baker Computer Science Club</h1>
      <p>
        The Baker Computer Science Club (CS Club) is a club started at Baker
        High School in late winter 2015.
      </p>
      <ul class="home-page-list">
        <li>
          <span class="title">When</span>
          <span>
            CS Club is every Tuesday after school in the computer science room (1431).
            We're always open to new members so stop by if you are interested.
          </span>
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="title">Why</span>
          <span>
            CS Club was founded by Ryan Gaus. He had been going to coding events
            in syracuse for the past 6 months and was dissapointed at the lack of
            high schoolers' involvement. CS Club is meant as an arena where everyone
            can increase their coding skills, while at the same time have fun.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="title">Goals</span>
          <span>
            Hopefully,
            we as a club can turn this into something like
            <a href="http://openhack.github.io">openhack</a> where everyone can help
            work on other's projects. Currently, you are looking at our first group
            project, this website!
        </li>

            If you'd like some more info, <a href="http://rgaus.net">here's</a>
            some contact information for the president, Ryan Gaus.
